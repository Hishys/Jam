Using Spotify API. I am going to develop a react-app that can search for Albums by Artist name.

I will be using vite to create my react application and fetch Api for Api integration. 
This project exposed me to CSS Bootstrap and how it can make styling simple.
Key takeaways: Console is your best friend when working with Api. If you can do Something in CSS then there is a easier way to do it in bootstrap. Api doc is a developers best friend. 



Future notes:
Try doing somethging bigger that handles more data. After I learn backend make an app and host it on AWS or any server.
